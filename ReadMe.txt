This application plays Youtube videos remotely once a twitter user posts a video with a certain prefix.
Post a video on twitter and have your computer play it over the speakers automatically without being near it.

Directions:
1. Download files to pc that intends to play the video/music

2. Click 'Run' file
	- The name prompt will be the prefix you will use when tweeting so the program knows you want to play
	it on a remote pc. Example names: Blake, Jim, videoparty, play, m, etc...
	- The twitter account name is the name of the twitter account that you will post to.

3. Post to twitter! The program will now wait for a video to be posted.
	THIS IS THE FORMAT:


	[name you chose]: [link]

	example posts:

		Blake: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKopy74weus
		Play: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pevWJuBL43s

4. Wait for song to play. The program will read how long the video is until another one can be posted.


Q: I messed up on the account name and/or user name. How can I change it?
A: Close the program and click 'run.' When asked if you want to use previous preferences type 'n' for no. The
	program will prompt you to enter the information.
	B. Alternatively, you may open the 'UserSetting.txt' and change your information there.

The possibilities are endless. You can use your phone to post and have it play on a pc across the world,
country or room!
